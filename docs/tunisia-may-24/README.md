# Generative AI and LLMs for Data Literacy

The first iteration of this course was delivered in Tunis, Tunisia, from May 27 to May 31, as part of the Data in Health Program organized by the World Bank Group and the African Development Bank.

## Session Details

### Audience
This session targeted staff from National Statistical Offices across 13 African countries, including Kenya, Tunisia, Burundi, Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Uganda, Central African Republic (RCA), Tanzania, and Mozambique.

### Organization
The course was divided into three phases, each tailored to maximize learning and engagement:

- **Phase 1: Virtual Session**  
  This brief, 3-hour virtual session introduced participants to the course content and sparked enthusiasm for the in-person session.

- **Phase 2: In-Person Session**  
  Conducted over five days, this phase combined two components: a 3-day module on big data, followed by this 2-day LLM course.

- **Phase 3: Project Implementation**  
  In this phase, participants applied what they learned in the previous sessions by building LLM-based applications, primarily chatbots, to facilitate the dissemination of information.
