# LLM Application Development with LangChain and Python
In this iteration of the course, participants will explore how to develop advanced applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) with the LangChain framework in Python. Through practical exercises and real-world case studies, the course dives into the technical aspects of building LLM-powered solutions, covering everything from prompt engineering to integrating various data sources and APIs. Participants will gain hands-on experience in creating dynamic applications, including intelligent chatbots and automated workflows. The course begins by providing a foundational understanding of LLMs—how they are trained and adapted for different domains through techniques like prompt engineering and fine-tuning. It then introduces LangChain, a leading framework for building LLM applications, empowering participants to enhance their business processes with LLMs. Ideal for developers, data scientists, data engineers, analysts, and professionals across industries such as banking, telecommunications, and the public sector, this course equips you with the skills needed to build your first production-grade LLM application.

The course is structured into self-contained modules, each building on the skills learned in previous ones. Each module includes lectures for key concepts, practical labs with programming activities and modifiable recipes, and case studies that showcase real-world applications. To reinforce learning, assessments combine theoretical and programming questions to evaluate the learner's understanding and skills gained.



## Session Details

### Audience
This session targeted staff from National Statistical Offices across 13 African countries, including Kenya, Tunisia, Burundi, Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Uganda, Central African Republic (RCA), Tanzania, and Mozambique.

### Organization
The course was divided into three phases, each tailored to maximize learning and engagement:

- **Phase 1: Virtual Session**  
  This brief, 3-hour virtual session introduced participants to the course content and sparked enthusiasm for the in-person session.

- **Phase 2: In-Person Session**  
  Conducted over five days, this phase combined two components: a 3-day module on big data, followed by this 2-day LLM course.

- **Phase 3: Project Implementation**  
  In this phase, participants applied what they learned in the previous sessions by building LLM-based applications, primarily chatbots, to facilitate the dissemination of information.
