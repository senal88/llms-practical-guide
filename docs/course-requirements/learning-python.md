# Python Environment Configuration
In this section, we provide the minimal Python packages required to complete the programming exercises in this course. We are saying minimal because for some of the project work, you may need extra packages

## Prerequisite Python Skills
A solid foundation in core Python skills is essential for building LLM-based applications with LangChain. These prerequisites enable efficient coding, debugging, and API interaction, which are critical for working effectively with language models. Below is a list of recommended skills to help you maximize your learning in this course.

- **Basic Python Programming**: Understanding variables, data types, and control structures (loops and conditionals).
- **Functions and Modules**: Ability to create and use functions, import modules, and manage dependencies.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Familiarity with classes, objects, inheritance, and basic OOP principles.
- **Working with APIs**: Understanding how to make HTTP requests and handle API responses, ideally with libraries like `requests`.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files, especially working with text files and JSON data.
- **Environment Management**: Experience with virtual environments (`venv`, `conda`) and package management with `pip`.
- **Error Handling**: Understanding of exceptions and error handling in Python.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Experience working with Jupyter Notebooks, especially for experimenting with and testing code interactively.

These prerequisites will provide a solid foundation for building applications with LangChain and LLMs.
