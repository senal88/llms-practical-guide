# Pre-Course Checklist

To help you prepare effectively for the course, we have summarized all the necessary steps in this checklist. The checklist provides links to the relevant sections as needed. Please ensure you go through each step and complete the required tasks.

## Pre-Course Checklist

Before the course begins, make sure you have completed the following steps:

1. **Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills**  
   Ensure you have reviewed the required sections to gain the necessary foundational knowledge in [Python](/docs/course-requirements/learning-python.md) and [Data Science and LLMs](/docs/course-requirements/data-science.md). These resources will help you build a strong foundation for the course content.

2. **Python Environment Setup**  
   Make sure Python is installed on your system. You should be able to use Jupyter Notebooks and have set up VS Code with all the required packages installed. Instructions for setting up your Python environment can be found in the [Python Environment Setup Section](/docs/course-requirements/python-environment.md).

3. **Sign Up for Platforms**  
   Register for accounts with OpenAI, Hugging Face, Twilio, AWS and GitHub. These platforms will be used throughout the course. Follow the instructions [here](/docs/course-requirements/platforms.md) to ensure you have signed up for these platforms and retrieved the necessary API keys.
